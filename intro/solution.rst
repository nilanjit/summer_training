Introduction
============

I am Nilanjit Mitra, a newbie in the world of GNU/Linux. I completed my B. Tech. this year in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Dr. B. C. Roy Engineering college, Durgapur. I have programming knowledge in C, HTML/CSS. When I am not working or studying I like to play guitar or listen music.

DGPLUG Summer Training:
-----------------------

It's been third week now since the DGPLUG(Durgapur Linux User's Group) Summer Training'13 has started. The learning experinence is really good as the sessions are interesting and also interactive. The training covers so many areas like communication guidelines(for mailing lists, IRC chats etc. to speak with mentors, upstream developers or fellow programmers), using GNU/Linux using shell commands, working with Vim Editor, GIT(Revision control Tool), programming in Python, to name a few.

The classes taken by `Kushal <http://www.kushaldas.in>`_ and `mbuf <http://www.shakthimaan.com>`_ were really nice. From the inroductory classes I came to know about the hacker community and FOSS culture. I found these links quite useful and motivating for newbies:

1. `If you want to do a project <http://shakthimaan.com/downloads.html#i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do>`_

2. `How to be a hacker <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>`_

3. `Mastering will take years <http://norvig.com/21-days.html>`_

The training is attended by around 50 people from all over the world. So, it is a good chance to meet like minded people who are interested to contribute to FOSS community.
