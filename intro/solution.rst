Introduction
============

I am Nilanjit Mitra, a newbie in the world of GNU/Linux. I completed my B. Tech. this year in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Dr. B. C. Roy Engineering college, Durgapur. I have programming knowledge in C, HTML/CSS. When I am not working or studying I like to play guitar or listen music.

DGPLUG Summer Training:
-----------------------

It's been third week now since the DGPLUG(Durgapur Linux User's Group) Summer Training'13 has started. The learning experinence is really good as the sessions are interesting and also interactive. The training covers so many areas like communication guidelines(for mailing lists, IRC chats etc. to speak with mentors, upstream developers or fellow programmers), using GNU/Linux, GIT(Revision control Tool), programming in Python and many more.

The classes taken by `Kushal <http://www.kushaldas.in>`_ and `mbuf <http://www.shakthimaan.com>`_ were really nice. I came to know about the hacker community working in the world of FOSS. I found these links quite useful and motivating for newbies:

1. `If you want to do a project <http://shakthimaan.com/downloads.html#i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do>`_

2. `How to be a hacker <http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>`_

3. `Mastering will take years <http://norvig.com/21-days.html>`_

The training is attended by around 50 people worldwide. So, it is a good chance to meet like minded people and make new friends.
